## What this code does
* Load Pittsburgh bridges data from UCI repository into an R data frame.  
* Select columns related to rivers, lanes, and lengths.  
* Change code from River = "A" to River = "Allegheny".  In the photo above, the Allegheny is the green colored river feeding into the Ohio; the rust-colored river is the Monongahela.

Very bare bones code, but a reasonable way to start.  Other work that should be done: rename column headers; change codes for other rivers from "O" to "Ohio" and "M" to "Monongahela", etc.

```{r}
#install.packages("RCurl")

library(RCurl)

url <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/bridges/bridges.data.version2"

bridge_data <-getURL(url)
#getwd()
bridge_df <- read.csv(text=bridge_data,header=F,sep=",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#bridge_df

head(bridge_df)
str(bridge_df)
bridge_df <- bridge_df[,c(2,6,7)]

#View(bridge_df)

# Three rivers are: Allegheny, Monongahela, Ohio
# Note that to get this code to work, we needed to go back to our read.csv, 
# and add stringsAsFactors = FALSE

bridge_df$V2[bridge_df$V2=="A"] <- "Allegheny"

#View(bridge_df)

str(bridge_df)
```

## Which rivers are in the dataset?  Is this correct?
## If I don't know how to do this, how would I find out?
